# TODO

- [x] `daten` needs to be sorted by `Date`
  - The `Dates` in `daten` struct currently is not sorted, this causes the resulting index.html to be displayed in random order.
- [x] Add more blogs sources
- [ ] Add better error handling

## Future Features

- [ ] Consider not running the go code in github actions to generate the index.html.
